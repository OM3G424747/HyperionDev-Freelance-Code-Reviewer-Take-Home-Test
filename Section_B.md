<H2>Section B</H2>

One of the projects I'm most proud of is a game I recently created this year and submitted for a Game Jam.
I decided to name the game "Super Space Rocks" and it's my take on the classic "Asteroids", but with more modern controls.

<H3>Game Jam Ranking</H3>
My number one goal for this submission was to create a game that's <strong>fun</strong> above all else!
Super Space Rocks was ranked as <strong>59</strong> out of all <strong>943</strong> submissions for the category of fun!
All submissions were scored only by developers who also took part in the Game Jam so that nobody could simply use their fans, family, or friends to boost their scores.

<H3>Further Inclusivity and Branding</H3>
I'm so proud of how my game performed, that I even animated a ThreeJS scene on my website recreating the game with 3D Voxel objects.

<H3>Summary</H3>
While I didn't need to put in the level of effort that I did for my submission, it was a matter of pride.
I take great pride in the quality of my work and had to ensure that even if it's just a Game Jam submission, then I would still need to deliver a quality product that the players will enjoy!
That's why I also included a browser version of my game.
While it wasn't developed to be played in a browser and this wasn't even a requirement, I wanted to make sure as many people as possible could play my game.
Some of the details I focused on include:
 - Particle Physics (particles from the player's jet engine will not only bounce off the cubes but will also cause particles to shoot out of the cube of the same colour making it look like they "chipped away" at the cube)
 - Cube rotation and direction in relation to the player's jet thrust and cube size (If you turn around and blast your thrusters in the direction of a cube, it will push it away and alter the rotation. This is most clearly seen on smaller cubes, while larger cubes are harder to push back and require more thrust)
 - Charged shot (This was 100% inspired by Megaman X, it just felt fun and helped the player ship feel more powerful)
 - Air breaks (Player feedback was that similar to the classic, the ship was hard to steer, so I included breaks to help bring it to a halt when needed)
 - Enemy AI ships (The original didn't have enemy ships, but because of the modern controls, the game became almost too easy and so I added enemy hunter ships to keep players on their toes. They will Ignore the player as long as they keep their distance, or don't fire in their direction)

Overall, the base game was finished within a single weekend, but I spend the rest of the Game Jam listening to feedback and making improvements to create a game that players would love!
I couldn't be more proud of the result and how to achieve similar results when I release my current project "Eat: A tale of consumption" on steam in the next year or so.
