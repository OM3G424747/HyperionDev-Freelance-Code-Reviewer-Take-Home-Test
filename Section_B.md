<H2>Section B</H2>

One of the projects I'm most proud of is a game I recently created this year and submitted for a Game Jam.
I decided to name the game "Super Space Rocks" and it's my take on the classic "Asteroids", but with more modern controls.

<H3>Game Jam Ranking</H3>
My number one goal for this submission was to create a game that's <strong>fun</strong> above all else!
Super Space Rocks was ranked as <strong>59</strong> out of all <strong>943</strong> submissions for the category of fun!
All submissions were scored only by developers who also took part in the Game Jam so that nobody could simply use their fans, family, or friends to boost their scores.

<H3>Further Inclusivity and Branding</H3>
I'm so proud of how my game performed, that I even animated a ThreeJS scene on my website recreating the game with 3D Voxel objects.

<H3>Summary</H3>
While I didn't need to put in the level of effort that I did for my submission, it was a matter of pride.
I take great pride in the quality of my work and had to ensure that even if it's just a Game Jam submission, then I would still need to deliver a quality product that the players will enjoy!
That's why I also included a browser version of my game.
While it wasn't developed to be played in a browser and this wasn't even a requirement, I wanted to make sure as many people as possible could play my game.
